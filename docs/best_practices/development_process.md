# Development Process

## The Five Phases

### Phase 1: Ideation
Discuss **what** you want to build, not **how** to build it.

**Output:** Design document / PRD (Product Requirements Document)

### Phase 2: Planning
Decide **how** to do it. Break into concrete steps.

**Output:** Implementation document (actionable + trackable, broken into smaller steps)

### Phase 3: Prototyping
Build and test the prototype. Can loop back to Ideation/Planning.

**Output:** Prototype

**Phases 1-3 form an iterative loop**

This iterative approach (Phases 1-3) is **Agile development**.
- We will discuss in class: What is Agile? How is it different from Waterfall?

### Phase 4: Rewriting/Refactoring
Enter this phase once prototype is stable and satisfactory.

**Output:** Robust code

### Phase 5: Consolidating
Test to solidify results and prevent regressions.

**Output:** Tested, stable codebase

## Key Principle

**Move through phases deliberately. Don't skip to implementation before proper planning.**
