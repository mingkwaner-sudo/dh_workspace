# Code Styles

## Core Principle

**All code must be cleanly written.**

---

## DON'Ts

### No Monkey Patching
- Don't modify code at runtime in hacky ways
- Don't patch third-party libraries without documentation

### No Spaghetti Code
- No tangled, hard-to-follow logic
- No unclear control flow
- No excessive nesting

### No Overengineering
- Don't build more than you need
- Don't add unnecessary abstraction layers
- Keep it simple

---

## DO's: Three Principles

### 1. Maintainability
- Code should be easy to maintain
- Future you (or others) should understand it
- Changes should be straightforward

### 2. Extensibility
- Code should be easy to extend
- New features should fit naturally
- Don't paint yourself into a corner

### 3. Modularization
- Break code into clear modules
- Each module has one clear purpose
- Modules should work independently

---

## Key Principle

**Clean code is code that others (and future you) can understand and modify.**
