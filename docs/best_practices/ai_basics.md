# AI Basics: General Rules for Interacting with AI Agents

---

## DO's

### Model Selection
- **Different AIs excel at different things** - assign tasks accordingly
  - Example (as of Oct 2025): GPT-5 for complex reasoning, Claude for coding
- **Each model has different modes/strengths**
  - Same model can be used with different intensity
  - ChatGPT-5: different model variants (hi, etc.)
  - Claude: extended thinking modes (extended thinking, etc.)
- **Know how to control the "strength" or effort level** of AI

### Prompting
- **Be clear and specific**
- **Longer is better than shorter** (provide context and details)
- **When uncertain, discuss first** - Discussion > Direction
- **State clear expectations** about what you want

### Provide Tools
- Give AI access to appropriate tools (MCP, etc.)
- Enable AI to use programmatic tools for data processing

## DON'Ts

### Trust Issues
- **Don't trust AI's judgment of your opinions**
  - AI is overflattering
  - Too eager to please
  - Will over-agree with you
  - Classic example: "You are absolutely right." (it has become a meme)

### Hallucination
- **Don't trust AI blindly**
- AI will fabricate information that sounds plausible
- Always verify critical outputs

### Data Processing - CRITICAL ⚠️
- **NEVER let AI process data directly**
  - Unless you have a verification process in place
  - Always use programmatic tools instead
  - Understand what "programmatic" means
- **Why this matters:**
  - Data falsification is a career-ending mistake
  - People lose jobs over this regularly
  - One of the most serious professional errors
  - Can happen without you noticing

### Self-Evaluation
- **Don't trust AI's evaluation of its own work**
  - Use external tools for verification
  - Apply hard standards/metrics
  - Better: Use a different rule set or new conversation thread

## Key Principle

**You are the orchestrator. AI is the tool.**
