# Week 8 Workshop: AI-Assisted Digital Project Development

## Workshop Overview

**Core Objectives:**

1. Help students understand AI's real capabilities and limitations
2. Position students firmly as orchestrators, not followers

**Demo Approach:**

- Pick one student's research project, or
- Choose a topic to demonstrate
- Walk through the complete process

## Student Problems (What We're Addressing)

1. Highly dependent on AI, being led by AI rather than directing it
2. Over-reliance on AI for information queries
3. Uncritical use of AI-generated data
4. No concept of "project" - only scattered files
5. No awareness of maintainability
6. No practice of self-audit
7. Lack of good project management processes
