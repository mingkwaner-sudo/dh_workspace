# Research Ethics

## Core Principle: Rigor

**Everything must be traceable and verifiable.**

---

## The Most Important Practical Rule

**Everything must have a source and be traceable**

This applies to:
- **Citations** - every quote, every reference
- **Data** - every dataset, every data point
- **Data transformation processes** - every step of processing

---

## Two Core Concepts

### 1. Traceability
- Can trace back to the source
- Can find where something came from
- Complete chain of custody

### 2. Verifiability
- Can be verified by others
- Can be checked for accuracy
- Evidence is available for inspection

## Data Handling

### Critical Rule: AI and Data

**AI agents absolutely cannot touch data directly.**

- **Must use programmatic means with records**
- Every data transformation must be documented
- Every step must be reproducible through code
- Never let AI manually process or transform data

### Why This Matters

- Ensures traceability
- Enables verification
- Prevents errors and falsification
- Maintains research integrity

## Key Principle

**If you can't trace it and verify it, it doesn't belong in your research.**
