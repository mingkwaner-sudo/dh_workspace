## Methodology

An interactive map of Hong Kong Island with Land Commission data layered on. Click on a district (e.g., Stanley) to see the records of Chinese-owned fields and kilns.
A side-by-side viewer. On one side, the Plover chart. On the other, a curated gallery of paintings and early photos, with key features (junks, jetties) annotated and linked.
A digitized collection of translated excerpts from the Man Mo Temple records and relevant Gazette notices, showing the formation of a civic body.
